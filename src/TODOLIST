NOTES: Here is where we can add/checkoff things to do for this app since we do not have tracker.

1. File structure: I have made a mess by throwing in some pages just to get more content going. So I need to clean that up.
2. Are we branching? do we need to? I didnt know so I made a branch anyways.
3. We should set up redux store? I was going to store the genre ids and names so we do not have to repeat that call or I can cache it?
4. Shall we have a service layer for our calls to this api? 
5. Different pages needed? I know I threw in some but we dont have to keep them.
